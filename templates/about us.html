      </div>
      <p id="paragraph">Alpha Taji Solutions Sacco was started in 2018 by <b>Sophie Mutua</b> then stationed at Survey of Kenya. In the same year it was registered and licensed as a limited savings and credit cooperative society. The Sacco is licensed by the Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority (SASRA) as a deposit taking Sacco. Since then, the Sacco has undergone various transformations and now boasts as one of the giant Saccoâ€™s in the country.</p>
      <p id="paragraph">The Annual Delegates Meeting (ADM) is the supreme governing authority of the Sacco. Delegates elect Board of Directors and the Supervisory Committee who run and oversee the organization on behalf of the members. Members are drawn from education institutions, other government departments and immediate families of the staff of these institutions. The Sacco offers both savings and credit services to this target group.</p>
